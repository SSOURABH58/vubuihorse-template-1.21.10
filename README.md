# VuBui Horse - Fireball Spitting Horses Mod 🐴🔥

## Why This Mod Exists

If you've watched Vu Bui's "LATEST GAME DROP DATE REVEAL! | MINECRAFT MONTHLY" video, you know exactly where this is going. When discussing the new Mounts of Mayhem update, Vu had a brilliantly ridiculous idea:

> "Okay, can we make horses spit fireballs?"

And you know what? That's exactly what we're doing. Because why should llamas have all the fun? It's time horses got their moment to shine... literally, with fire.

## What This Mod Does

This mod transforms every horse in Minecraft into a majestic, fireball-spitting beast. Here's what you're getting:

### 🔥 Fireball Mechanics
- **All horses can spit fireballs** - Uses the classic ghast fireball animations and mechanics
- **No block destruction** - Fireballs deal entity damage only, your builds are safe!
- **Fire spread enabled** - Things will catch fire, because that's just more fun

### 🎯 Behavior System
- **Passive by default** - Horses remain peaceful until provoked
- **Defensive spitting** - Hit a horse and it'll remember YOU specifically and spit fireballs at you
- **Player-only targeting** - Horses only target players who hurt them, not other mobs
- **Wild horse aggression** - Untamed horses will occasionally spit fireballs at nearby hostile mobs (not players)
- **Tamed horses are peaceful** - Once tamed, horses only spit on player command

### 🎮 Player Controls
- **Keybind for tamed horses** - Once you've tamed and saddled a horse, press R (customizable) to make it shoot fireballs
- **Aim-based shooting** - Fireballs go where you're looking, not straight up!
- **Cooldown display** - See the cooldown timer at the top-left of your screen (like potion effects) with a fire icon
- **Customizable keybind** - Change the key in Controls > VuBui Horse section
- **Cooldown system** - Random cooldown between 5-10 seconds (configurable) to keep things balanced

### 🧬 Genetic Trait
- **Hereditary ability** - The fireball-spitting trait passes to offspring when breeding
- **Build your army** - Breed an entire stable of fire-breathing war horses
